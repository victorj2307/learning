## About

This repo is dedicated to hands-on learning. Here you'll find:

- Small exercises to practice specific concepts  
- Code experiments exploring new technologies or libraries  
- Mini-projects or proofs-of-concept  
- Notes or explanations to reinforce my understanding  

The goal is not to produce production-ready code, but to **learn by doing**.

---

## Technologies

I work with a variety of technologies, including but not limited to:

- **Backend:** .NET Core, C#, Node.js  
- **Frontend:** Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript  
- **Databases:** SQL Server, PostgreSQL  
- **Cloud / DevOps:** Azure, GitHub Actions  
- **Other tools:** Python, Docker, REST APIs  

This list will grow as I explore new topics.
